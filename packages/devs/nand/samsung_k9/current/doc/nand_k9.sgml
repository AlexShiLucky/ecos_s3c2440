<title>Samsung K9 family NAND chips</title>
<sect1 id="nanddev-samsung-k9-overview">
<title>Overview</title>

<para>
The <varname>CYGPKG_DEVS_NAND_SAMSUNG_K9</varname> driver package currently
provides support for the Samsung K9F1G08, K9F2G08 and K9F1208 series of NAND flash chips, and
is intended to be expanded to provide support for more of the K9 family.
</para>

<para>
Most users will not need to interact with this package; it should be included
as a hardware dependency on all appropriate targets.
This package provides only an
inline code fragment which is intended to be instantiated by the target
platform HAL and provided with appropriate board-specific low-level
functions allowing it to access the hardware.
</para>

<note><para> The large-page parts in this family are not quite 
ONFI-compliant, but this code could
probably be extended to a much wider set of chips - or indeed to the ONFI
specification - without too much trouble. Appropriate definitions will
be required for the chip identifier, decoding of the Read ID response,
and the chip's blockcount-bits and device-size fields.
</para>
</note>

<note><para> At the present time, this driver has the limitation that it only
supports 8-bit parts.  This is an area of probable future expansion.
</para></note>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="devs-nand-samsung-k9-instantiation"><title>Using this driver in a board port</title>
<para>
This driver's top-level chip support is currently provided as two files:</para>

<glosslist>
<glossentry><glossterm><filename>cyg/devs/nand/k9_generic.h</filename></glossterm>
<glossdef><para>Prototypes the low-level chip access functions required by the chip driver and
declares a private struct for use by the driver.</para></glossdef></glossentry>
<glossentry><glossterm><filename>cyg/devs/nand/k9_generic.inl</filename></glossterm>
<glossdef><para>Implements high-level chip functions and exposes them via the <constant>CYG_NAND_FUNS</constant> macro.  
This file is not intended to be compiled on its own, but to be included by the source file in a platform HAL which implements the low-level functions.
</para></glossdef></glossentry>
</glosslist>

<para> A platform HAL would typically make use of this driver in a single source file
with the following steps:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> Declare a local private struct with contents as appropriate,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <filename>#include &lt;cyg/devs/nand/k9_generic.h&gt;</filename></para></listitem>
<listitem><para> implement the required low-level functions,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <filename>#include &lt;cyg/devs/nand/k9_generic.inl&gt;</filename></para></listitem>
<listitem><para> declare a list of the supported <constant>k9_subtype</constant> which may appear on the board, terminated by <constant>K9_SUBTYPE_SENTINEL</constant></para></listitem>
<listitem><para> declare a static instance of the <constant>k9_priv</constant> struct containing pointers to that list and to an instance of the local-private struct</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> finally, instantiate the chip with the <constant>CYG_NAND_DEVICE</constant> macro, selecting the ECC and OOB semantics to use.
<note><para>If there is more than one chip on the board, each needs its own CYG_NAND_DEVICE with a distinct name and device name, its own instance of the k9_priv struct.</para></note>
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
For more details about the infrastructure provided by the NAND layer
and the semantics it expects of the chip driver, refer to 
<xref linkend="io-nand-overview">. An example driver instantiation can be
found in the NAND driver for the EA LPC2468 platform.</para>

<sect2 id="nanddev-samsung-k9-memory-note">
<title>Memory usage</title>
<para>
As discussed in <xref linkend="nand-devs-highlevel">, the chip
initialisation function must set up the <varname>bbt.data</varname>
pointer in the <type>cyg_nand_device</type> struct.  This driver does so
by including a large byte array in the <type>k9_priv</type>
struct whose size is controlled by CDL depending on the enabled
chip support.
That struct is intended to be allocated as a static struct in the
data or BSS segment (one per chip), which avoids adding a dependency
on <function>malloc</function>.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="nanddev-samsung-k9-functions-required">
<title>Low-level functions required from the platform HAL</title>
<para>
These functions are prototyped in 
<filename>k9_generic.h</filename>.
They have no return value ("void"), except for
<function>read_data_1</function> which returns the byte it has read.</para>

<glosslist>
<glossentry><glossterm><function>write_cmd(device,
command)</function></glossterm><glossdef><para>Writes a single command
byte to the chip's command latch.</para></glossdef></glossentry>

of address bytes in turn to the chip's address latch.</para></glossdef></glossentry>
<glossentry><glossterm><function>CYG_BYTE read_data_1(device)</function>,
<function>read_data_bulk(device, output pointer, number of
bytes)</function></glossterm><glossdef><para>Reads data from the device,
respectively a single byte and in bulk.</para></glossdef></glossentry>

time delay (measured in microseconds).</para></glossdef></glossentry>
<glossentry><glossterm><function>wait_ready_or_status(device,
mask)</function></glossterm><glossdef><para>Wait for the chip to signal

its Status register (ANDed with the given mask) to be non-zero.</para></glossdef></glossentry>
<glossentry><glossterm><function>k9_devlock(device)</function>,
<function>k9_devunlock(device)</function></glossterm>
<glossdef><para>Hooks for any board-specific locking which may be required in
addition to the NAND library's chip-level locking. (This would be useful if, for example, 
access to multiple chips was mediated by a single set of GPIO lines which ought not to be
invoked concurrently.)</para>
</glossdef></glossentry>
<glossentry><glossterm><function>k9_plf_init(device)</function></glossterm>
<glossdef><para>Board-level platform initialisation hook. This is called very early
on in the chip initialisation routine; it should set up any locking required by the
devlock and devunlock functions, interrupts for the driver and any further lines
required to access the chip as approprate.
<emphasis>Once this has returned, the chip driver assumes that the platform is fully prepared
for it to call the other chip access functions.</emphasis></para>
</glossdef></glossentry>
<glossentry><glossterm><function>k9_plf_partition_setup(device)</function></glossterm>
<glossdef><para>Board-level partition initialisation hook.
This should set up the <varname>partition</varname> array of the device struct in a way which
is appropriate to the platform. For example, the partitions may be set as fixed ranges
of blocks, or by CDL. This is called at the end of the chip initialisation routine and may,
for example, call into the chip to read out a "partition table" if one is present on the board.
<emphasis>If you do not set up partitions, applications will not be able to use the high-level
chip access functions provided the NAND library.</emphasis></para>
