	* Break out large page device specific support into k9_generic_lp.inl,
	add CYGFUN_NAND_SAMSUNG_K9_LP
	* Add small page device support to k9_generic_sp.inl (mediated by
	CYGFUN_NAND_SAMSUNG_K9_SP)
	* Add K9G12 chip support (small-page)

2010-03-12	Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* k9fxx08x0x.{c,inl}: Renamed to k9_generic.{c,inl}.
	* Add K9F2G chip support

2009-11-13  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* Don't provide BBT data when the NAND layer doesn't call for it.

2009-11-09  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* Add read_part_page function.

2009-10-02  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* Update driver to expose v2 device functions.

2009-09-02  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* nand_k9.sgml: Created (by breaking up docs in io/nand/)

2009-07-02  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* k9fxx08x0x.inl: Don't unnecessarily reset the chip. Minor
	optimisation to k9_write_page.

2009-06-16  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* Refactor to have a chip-level priv struct with per-chip in-RAM BBT.
	* include/k9fxx08x0x.h: Created.
	* Properly allow platform to define where the locking should be.
	* Replace use of diag_printf with NAND_ERROR.
	* Retab for consistency with other eCos sources.
