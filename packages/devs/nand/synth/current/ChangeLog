	* nand_synth.c, nand_synth.cdl: Allow simulation of multiple
	writes to a page if CYGSEM_NAND_SYNTH_ALLOW_MULTIPLE_WRITES
	is set.

2009-11-13  Ross Younger  <wry@ecoscentric.com>

	* Don't provide BBT data if it's not called for.

2009-11-09  Ross Younger  <wry@ecoscentric.com>

	* nand_synth.c: Provide read_part_page function.

2009-11-06  Ross Younger  <wry@ecoscentric.com>

	* nand_synth.c: Use new fast ECC implementation.

2009-10-19  Ross Younger  <wry@ecoscentric.com>

	* nand_synth.c: Update to interface v2.
	* nand_synth.cdl: Require CYGSEM_IO_NAND_INTERFACE_VERSION >= 2.

2009-09-28  Ross Younger  <wry@ecoscentric.com>

	* tests: Don't put unreasonably large arrays on stack. Build-fix
	multipagebbt.

2009-09-16  Ross Younger  <wry@ecoscentric.com>

	* tests: Buildfix bbt.c and eccdamage.c
	* nand_synth.c: Ensure that bit errors induced by RANDOMLY_LOSE mode
	can occur over the whole range of the page data and spare area.

2009-08-28  Ross Younger  <wry@ecoscentric.com>

	* tests: Add bbt.c and multipagebbt.c (moved from io/nand).
	* doc/synth_nand.sgml: Document this device's test programs.

2009-07-31  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* doc/synth_nand.sgml, src/nand_synth.c: add support for per-block
	erase counts and per-page write counts to monitor wear-levelling.

2009-07-14  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* host/nand.tcl (dialog): avoid the use of max() for compatibility
	with ancient Tcl 8.4 installations.

	* host/configure.in: allow builds on x86_64 machines.

	* host/configure: regenerate.

	*  doc/synth_nand.sgml, doc/dialog1.png, doc/dialog2.png: add
	documentation.

2009-07-09  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* host/nand.tcl, host/nand.tdf, src/nand_synth.c: first attempt at
	a full-blown implementation complete with logging and error
	injection.

	* cdl/nand_synth.cdl: add dependencies on other packages. Fix name
	of CYGDAT_NAND_SYNTH_FILENAME option as per CDL coding standards.

2009-06-17  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* Retab for consistency with other eCos sources.
	* Move eccdamage test from io/nand.

2009-03-06  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* New package. Synthetic NAND flash chip.
