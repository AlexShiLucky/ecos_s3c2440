2010-04-20  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* nand_ecc.h nand.c: Expand ECC interface to allow different
	calculate functions during reads and writes, as needed by some
	hardware ECC implementations. Defines
	CYGSEM_IO_NAND_ECC_SPLIT_FUNCTION.
	* nandunit.c nand_eccequiv.c nand_sweccwalk.c: Fix up.
	* nand.c nand_oob.c: Fix uninitialised OOB issue.

	the spare area works as expected.

2010-03-12  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* nand.c: Short-cut zero-length part-reads; don't pass them on to the
	underlying driver.
	* nand.h: Correct off-by-one error (in the safe direction) in the
	definition of CYG_NAND_PARTITION_NBLOCKS.

2009-11-24  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* tests/rwbenchmark.c: Add bulk-read and bulk-write modes
	which measure time for a whole block. Improve timing output 
	to scale itself to milliseconds where appropriate.

	for use in other packages.

2009-11-19  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	Significant interface change.
	* nand.h: Application-facing functions now take partition-relative
	addresses, not device-relative addresses. 
	Rename functions cyg_nand_* -> cyg_nandp_* to reflect this (change the
	interface, change the name).
	Create helper macros CYG_NAND_PARTITION_N{BLOCKS,PAGES}.
	Rename NAND_* macros to CYG_NAND_*.
	* tests, utils: Update to new semantics.
	* nand.cdl: Declare CYGSEM_IO_NAND_APPINTERFACE_VERSION 
	- calculated, 2 - and add a tripwire to ensure YAFFS is updated.

2009-11-09  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* nand.h: Rationalise interface:
	  * read_page: now only reads a whole page and/or its spare.
	  * read_part_page: Created.  Allows part-pages and optionally
	  not checking ECC.
	  * write_page: now only writes a whole page and/or its spare.
	  + nand_ecc.h: Drop earlier attempt to support sub-page ECC.
	* tests/readwrite.c: Test out cyg_nand_read_part_page().
	* tests: Update for interface tweak.
	* nand_bbt.c: Rationalise BBT finding into one place and fix to 
	better cope with the situation where only one BBT block had
	been written. Cure an internal race.
	* nand_ecc_mtd_fast.c: Speed up checking phase.

2009-11-06  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* nand_ecc_mtd_fast.c: Created. Complete rewrite of software 
	ECC for massive performance boost. In summary, use all 32 bits
	of a register at once, and part-unroll the operation. (Also
	rewrote the ecc repair function to drop the dependency on the
	previous (imported) code.
	* tests: Update to suit the above.
	* tests/eccequiv.c: Created (used to test new ECC implementation).

2009-10-28  Ross Younger  <wry@eCosCentric.com>

	* nand.cdl, nand.c, nand_bbt.[ch]: CYGSEM_IO_NAND_USE_BBT
	implemented (default on).  Updated tests and utils to suit.
	* nand.cdl: Add convenience options to build the utils as well
	as the tests.
	* tests/sweccwalk.c: Created (software ECC bit-walker and repair
	consistency checks)
	* nand.sgml: Updated for the above. Documented ECC algorithm
	interface.
	* tests/rwbenchmark.c: Have rwbenchmark use randomised test data
	and check its work for better validity.

	* Global: Create a per-device lock to remove this burden from drivers.

	* tests: Tweak to make more likely to work in a minimal config.
	Move mkvector.c and ar4test.c into misc/.
