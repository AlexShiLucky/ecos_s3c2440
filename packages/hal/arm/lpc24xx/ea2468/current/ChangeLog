	* ea_lpc2468_nand.c: Tweak for updated k9 family NAND driver.

2009-11-10  Ross Younger <wry@ecoscentric.com>

	* ea_lpc2468_nand.c: Fix interrupt-mode brokenness when the debug
	  level was low.
	  Add heuristic to improve I/O throughput.
	  Tune the EMC timings to speed up NAND access.

2009-11-06  Ross Younger <wry@ecoscentric.com>

	* ea_lpc2468_nand.c: Use mtd_ecc256_fast, not linux_mtd_ecc.

2009-08-18  Ross Younger <wry@ecoscentric.com>

	* ea_lpc_2468_nand.c: Minor bugfix - attach on the interrupt handle,
	not the interrupt object, even if it's currently inconsequential.

2009-07-02  Ross Younger <wry@ecoscentric.com>

	* ea_lpc_2468_nand.c: Small optimisations:
	+ Condition-out poll-counting unless it's being reported.
	+ Properly defined initial-wait semantics for wait_ready_polled;
	tweak callers to match.
	+ Don't bother with an interrupt-assisted sleep for a small 
	time (i.e. a page read).

2009-06-05  Ross Younger <wry@ecoscentric.com>

	* ea_lpc_2468_nand.c: refactor for k9fxx08x0x changes; retab.
	* * BBT per-chip
	* * provide for locking though we don't use it on this board.

2009-05-27  Ross Younger <wry@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/ea_lpc_2468_nand.c: Rip out eCosPro HAL ifdefs & partial rewrite
